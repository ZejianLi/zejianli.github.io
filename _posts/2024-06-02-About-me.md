## Biography 简介

Zejian Li is an Platform Top 100 Researcher with School of Software Technology, Zhejiang University, China. He is a member of International Design Institue, working closely with Prof. Lingyun Sun. He received his Ph.D. degree from Zhejiang University, China, in 2019. His Ph.D advisor is Prof. Yongchuan Tang. His research interests include generative models and intelligent design.

李泽健是浙江大学软件学院平台“百人计划”研究员，是浙江大学国际设计研究院孙凌云教授团队的成员。他2019年在浙江大学获得计算机科学与技术博士学位，导师是汤永川教授。他的研究方向主要为生成模型和智能设计。


## Research Interests 研究兴趣

Generative Models, intelligent design
生成模型，智能设计

Specific research interests:
    Controllable Image/3D/4D generation
    Training and Distillation of Diffusion Models
    Evaluation of Generative Content
    Interative Human-AI Cocreation

具体研究焦点：
    可控 图像/3D/4D 内容生成
    扩散模型训练和蒸馏
    生成内容质量评估
    交互式人机协同创作


## Openings / Internship  招募和实习

I am looking for self-motivated PhD, master and undergraduate students to join my research group! If you are interested in generative models, Human-AI cocreation and want to join us, please send me your CV to zejianlee at zju.edu.cn. Notice that right now I only have master quota of industrial design engineering, but not software engineering or artificial intelligence. 

本人团队招收博士生、硕士生和对科研感兴趣的本科生！如果你对生成模型、人机协同创作的研究感兴趣，有意向加入我们团队，欢迎发邮件到zejianlee at zju.edu.cn，请附个人简历。因本人属于设计学科的团队，硕士名额暂时只有工业设计工程。技术背景的硕士依然从事AI研究，设计背景的硕士从事交互方向研究，特此说明。

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.

> They can span multiple paragraphs,

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. ☺



An h2 header
------------

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
~~~

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

~~~python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print(i)
~~~



### An h3 header ###

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local
doc](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current
doc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote [^1].

[^1]: Some footnote text.

Tables can look like this:

Name           Size  Material      Color
------------- -----  ------------  ------------
All Business      9  leather       brown
Roundabout       10  hemp canvas   natural
Cinderella       11  glass         transparent

Table: Shoes sizes, materials, and colors.

(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports
multi-line tables:

--------  -----------------------
Keyword   Text
--------  -----------------------
red       Sunsets, apples, and
          other red or reddish
          things.

green     Leaves, grass, frogs
          and other things it's
          not easy being.
--------  -----------------------

A horizontal rule follows.

***

Here's a definition list:

apples
  : Good for making applesauce.

oranges
  : Citrus!

tomatoes
  : There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term and  its definition to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block" (note how whitespace is honored):

| Line one
|   Line too
| Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

Inline math equation: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line like so:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc. -->
